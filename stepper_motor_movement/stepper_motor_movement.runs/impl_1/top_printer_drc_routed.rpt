2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_printer_controller/x_dir_nxt_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_printer_controller/x_dir_nxt_reg/L3_2/O, cell u_printer_controller/x_dir_nxt_reg/L3_2 (in u_printer_controller/x_dir_nxt_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_printer_controller/x_dir_nxt_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_printer_controller/x_dir_nxt_reg_i_1/O, cell u_printer_controller/x_dir_nxt_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_printer_controller/y_dir_nxt__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_printer_controller/y_dir_nxt_reg_i_1/O, cell u_printer_controller/y_dir_nxt_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_printer_controller/z_dir_nxt3_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_printer_controller/z_dir_nxt_reg_i_1/O, cell u_printer_controller/z_dir_nxt_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
